title: About Us 
---
The Independent Writing Departments and Programs Association (IWDPA) represents primarily departments and programs whose curricula and activities explore the production of written communication—exclusively or in relation to other modes of signification—and /or engage in the study of writers and the activity of writing in contemporary and historical contexts. It welcomes all types of freestanding academic units – from departments to programs to centers.

Its goals are to

* represent a diverse and geographically dispersed body of independent writing programs and departments
* foster communication among independent writing programs and departments
* investigate, clarify, and communicate the needs and interests of independent writing programs and departments
* promote collaboration among independent writing programs and departments in defining outcomes, generating research, and developing best practices for teaching and administration
* build and nurture alliances between independent writing programs and departments and related programs such as first year experience, Writing Centers, and WAC/WID
* support the growth of independent writing departments and programs by assisting those interested in creating such units in their home institutions
* investigate and promote discussion of and collaboration among undergraduate majors in writing and rhetoric
