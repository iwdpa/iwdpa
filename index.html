The Independent Writing Departments and Programs Association (IWDPA) represents primarily departments and programs whose curricula and activities explore the production of written communication—exclusively or in relation to other modes of signification—and /or engage in the study of writers and the activity of writing in contemporary and historical contexts. It welcomes all types of freestanding academic units – from departments to programs to centers.
